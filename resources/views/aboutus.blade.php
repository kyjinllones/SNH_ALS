		<h2>About Us</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The Alternative Learning System is a parallel learning system in the Philippines that provides a practical option to the existing formal instruction. 
      When one does not have or cannot access formal education in schools, ALS is an alternate or substitute. 
      <br><br>ALS includes both the non-formal and informal sources of knowledge and skills.
      The Alternative Learning System only requires learners to attend learning sessions based on the agreed schedule between the learners and the learning facilitators.
      <br><br>The program has two different schematics for conducting instruction: 
      school-based and community-based. On the school-based program, instructions are conducted in school campuses while in the community-based program, 
      formal instruction are conducted in community halls or on private places. 
      <br><br>The ALS program follows a uniform lesson modules for all academic subjects covering the sciences, mathematics, English, Filipino, social studies, current events among others. Delivery of instructions are provided by government-paid instructors or by private non-government organization.
      <br><br>Aside from schematics, the program has two levels: elementary and secondary. 
      Students have to start from elementary level, then proceed to high school level. 
      If a student is a graduate of elementary under a formal classroom system, 
      the student is automatically admitted to the secondary levels depending on which year level the student stopped schooling.</p>
